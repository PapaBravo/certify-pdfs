== Introduction & Goals
This document is a written in https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoc] and follows the https://arc42.org/[arc42] template.

=== Requirements Overview
The goal of this system is to provide a generic service that can render a _pdf_ document from a _claim_ and a _template_. 
The resulting document should contain a _cryptographic signature_ that can be validated even when the document is printed (as opposed to just digitally signing the binary file).

=== Quality Goals
While the implementation is only on a prototype level, the architecture of the system should be usable in real world scenarios.

|# |Name |Description

|1 |Learning | This project is mostly for learning about the cryptographic methods and kubernetes.
|2 |Secure | The cryptographic scheme should be secure in priniple even if the concrete implementation as an MVP takes shortcuts.
|3 |Scalable | The system should be designed to scale in a large inhouse cloud system.
|4 |Generic | The system should be generic in the sense that multiple different use cases can be supported with little additional effort.

=== Technical Context
The api description can be found in the link:/doc/certify.openapi.yaml[repository] and can be rendered with the https://editor.swagger.io/[swagger editor].

== Solution Strategy
The system uses the https://redis.io/docs/manual/pubsub/[redis pubsup] mechanism as a simple work queue. That way the technologically complex rendering process is isolated and can be changed later. It also allowes independend scaling of the resource demanding task.

The claim is stringified and a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515[JSON Web Signature (JWS)] is generated. This signature is embedded in the resulting pdf document both in plain text and as a convinient QRCode leading to a verification endpoint.

== Architectual Decisions

[cols="2,10"]
|===
| Title | Description 

| No Certificates 
| The cryptographic implementation only uses public/private key pairs instead of a PKI. 

This will require a refactoring when a full tenant system is implemented.

The reason for this choice was ease of implementation.
| Redis as Queue 
| Instead of using a full fletched queue system like RabbitMQ or Kafka, the Redis PubSub mechanism is used.

It is likely that future extensions of the system require a more robust feature set on the queue. Refactoring the system to use a different queue should be doable with moderate effort.

Again, the main reason for the decision was ease of implementation, specifically avoiding additional components to be deployed.

== Quality Requirements

== Risks and Technical Debt

[cols="1,5,5"]
|===
| Title | Description | Mitigation

| No Certificates 
| The cryptographic implementation only uses public/private key pairs instead of a PKI.
| When moving to one key per document, the switch to a PKI has to be made. The crypto library https://github.com/cisco/node-jose#managing-keys[node-jose] supports PKIX X.509 certificates.

| No Auth 
| Currently all endpoints, specifically the sign endpoint is not protected in any way. 
| The used HTTP server library https://expressjs.com/[express] has OIDC supporting https://github.com/auth0/express-openid-connect[middleware] available.
